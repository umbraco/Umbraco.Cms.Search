# The backoffice

Umbraco Search adds a Search section to the Umbraco backoffice, providing tools for inspecting and managing search indexes.

> [!NOTE]
> This guide requires the `Umbraco.Cms.Search.BackOffice` package to be installed. See the [installation instructions](../README.md#the-backoffice-search) for details.

## Accessing Search

Navigate to **Settings > Search** in the Umbraco backoffice. The Search section is available to users with access to the Settings section.

## Index overview

The root view displays a table of all registered search indexes. Each row shows:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Alias** | The index alias (e.g. `Umb_PublishedContent`, `Umb_Content`, `Umb_Media`, `Umb_Members`) |
| **Health** | The current health status of the index |
| **Documents** | The number of documents currently in the index |

Each row also has an entity action dropdown for per-index operations like rebuilding.

## Index detail view

Click an index row to open its detail view. The detail view uses a two-column layout with extensible boxes:

- **Left column**: The search box for testing queries against the index.
- **Right column**: The stats box showing the index alias, document count, and health status.

Search providers can add additional boxes to either column (see [Extending the search backoffice](backoffice-extensions.md)).

## Searching documents

The search box allows you to test queries directly against an index:

1. Enter a full-text search query in the input field.
2. Results appear in a table showing document ID, name, object type, and relevance score.
3. Use pagination controls at the bottom to navigate through results.

### Culture selection

For multilingual sites, a set of culture tabs appears above the search box. Selecting a culture filters the search to include documents in that culture (invariant content is always included). The selected culture is reflected in the URL for bookmarking.

### Search results table

Each result row displays:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Document ID** | The content key (clickable link to open the content item) |
| **Name** | The document name |
| **Object type** | The content type (e.g. "Document", "Media") |
| **Score** | The relevance score for the search query |

An entity action dropdown on each row provides per-document actions. The available actions depend on which search providers are installed (e.g. the Examine provider adds a "Show Fields" action).

## Index health status

Each index reports a health status:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Healthy** | The index is operational and up to date |
| **Rebuilding** | The index is currently being rebuilt |
| **Empty** | The index contains no documents |
| **Corrupted** | The index is in a bad state and needs rebuilding |

## Rebuilding an index

To rebuild an index:

1. **From the collection view**: Click the entity action dropdown on the index row and select "Rebuild Index".
2. **From the detail view**: Click the entity action dropdown in the workspace header and select "Rebuild Index".

During a rebuild:
- The detail view shows a loading indicator.
- The collection view shows a "Rebuilding" health status for the index.
- When the rebuild completes, the server sends a notification via SignalR and the UI updates automatically.
